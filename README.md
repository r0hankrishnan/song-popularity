## Song Popularity Prediction Project

This is an expansion of the final project for STAT 1361. In this project we are given a data set containing a list of songs across three genres (pop, rock, and jazz), their characteristics, and their popularities. I will explore the data and then create several models to predict a song's popularity based on the given information.
