## Song Popularity Prediction Project

This is an expansion of the final project for STAT 1361. In this project we are given a data set containing a list of songs across three genres (pop, rock, and jazz), their characteristics, and their popularities. I will explore the data and then create several models to predict a song's popularity based on the given information.

## Introduction
SonicWave Productions is a growing company seeking to gain headway in the music industry. The music industry is valued at 14.34 billion as of 2024 and is projected to consistently grow in the following years (Statista, 2024). To gain a competitive advantage and grow SonicWaveâ€™s market share, it is imperative to understand what factors are most important in creating a popular song.

As a Data Science Consultant , I was hired to predict the popularity of songs from rock, jazz, and pop genres. I was provided a data set with 1200 observations across 19 variables that encompassed various song metrics. Such a model would empower their team of music professionals to swiftly identify songs that are either undervalued or overvalued in the market, facilitating strategic decisions in song selection, promotion, and distribution. In this README, I will highlight the analyses I conducted to understand the relationships within the data, how I cleaned the data, the models I developed and how they performed, and my final takeaways regarding how the models should or should not be utilized.
